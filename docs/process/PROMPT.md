# Current Prompt

## Comments

Is MILESTONE.md still relevant if we are using a GitHub Issues workflow?
In theory, keeping PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md around would have been useful, but losing it is not a big deal as there is a lot of prompt history.

Issues have broken links.
V0.1-Mx series issues link to this file:
- https://github.com/sgeos/cordial_cantina/issues/docs/decisions/RESOLVED.md

The correct link is:
- https://github.com/sgeos/cordial_cantina/tree/main/docs/decisions/RESOLVED.md

Some point to anchors in the file.
Getting these fixed is nice to have. As is, nothing is blocked.

Also, comment on whether or not you feel the process is established and in order after these fixes.

## Objectives

### Resolve Broken CI

See the following URL:
https://github.com/sgeos/cordial_cantina/actions/runs/21602670339/job/62252449635

The "run precommit checks" is failing.
Local server runs fine.

### Fix Broken Links

Fix the broken links in the issues if straightforward.
If not straightforward, report as non-trivial with reasoning.

## Context

I want CI in order before we move onto V0.1 development.
It is a process issue at this point.

## Constraints

(no instructions)

## Success Criteria

- CI passes.
- Links in issues are resolved, or reported as non-trivial fix with reasoning.
