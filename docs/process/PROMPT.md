# Current Prompt

## Comments

Your expected workflow follows.
- Parse prompt.
- Execute tasks.
- Overwrite REVERSE_PROMPT.md.
- Commit all changes with an appropriate message.

If commits are breaking, I will roll back.
If this process is not codified, then please record it.
Barring special instructions to deviate from standard procedure, follow this process.

`scripts` is a fine place to put scripts.
I have used `tools` in the past.
Feel free to use the more conventional location.

## Objective

Please add script execution to as a git pre-commit hook to enforce coverage locally.

## Context

Reasonable reverse prompt suggestion.

## Constraints

(no instructions)

## Success Criteria

Process codification verified.
Pre-commit hook tested and working.

## Notes

(covered in comments, above)
