# Current Prompt

## Comments

We will close the Process Definition macro-milestone and move to V0.1 implementation once issues are in order.

CI is broken, but we can address that next prompt.

## Objectives

### New Issue: GitHub Projects Integration

Create an issue that addresses "GitHub Projects Integration."
This issue should mention consideration of GitHub Projects in the future, with pros and cons.
It should also mention that Linear and Notion were considered but rejected.
Rejection logic should be listed.

### Resolve Issue: B6: CLAUDE.md inclusion strategy

Present strategy is acceptable barring a strong counter argument.
Please refute and offer a better alternative, or resolve.

### Issue: B3: Add CHANGELOG.md for milestone completion history

Accept suggestion. Add CHANGELOG.md to provide a user-facing summary of releases.
Construct from existing but depreciated markdown based project management files.
Subsequently remove depreciated markdown based project management files.
Document process changes:
- GitHub Issues as opposed markdown based project management.
- CHANGELOG.md provides a user-facing summary of releases.

## Context

In addition to migrating to GitHub issues, we need to make sure the new system is in order.

## Constraints
