# Prompt Staging Area

> **Navigation**: [Process](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

This file is a staging area for complex human-to-AI instructions. The human pilot drafts and refines prompts here before execution.

---

# Current Prompt

## Objective

Please draft the following files.
- `docs/process/MILESTONE_TEMPLATE.md`: for creating new milestones consistently.
- `docs/process/PROMPT_BACKLOG.md`: so that the human pilot can record multiple AI-agent concerns that need to be addressed. Unless recorded, they will be lost when REVERSE_PROMPT.md is overwritten.

Also, audit the documentation to make sure that all files present in the documentation filesystem are properly documented.

## Context

Process needs more structure.

## Constraints

(no instructions)

## Success Criteria

All files are present, documented, and properly committed.

## Notes

I copied `docs/process/PROMPT.md` to `docs/process/PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`, but did not commit the change.
The first version of the file seemed like it was worth preserving.
