# Prompt Backlog

> **Navigation**: [Process](./README.md) | [Documentation Root](../README.md)

This file records AI-agent concerns, questions, and suggestions that need human attention. Items here persist across REVERSE_PROMPT.md overwrites.

## How to Use

**AI agents**: When overwriting REVERSE_PROMPT.md, copy important unresolved items here before they are lost.

**Human pilot**: Review this backlog periodically. Mark items as resolved or transfer to appropriate documents.
